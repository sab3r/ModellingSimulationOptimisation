# Modelling, Simulation, and Optimisation

This project was undertaken as part of the *Modelling, Simulation, and Optimisation* module of MSc. Data Analytics course in National College of Ireland

### Simulation

- Simulation of a high speed railway network between London and Birmingham with *n* trains running per hour and *k* signalling blocks on the 145km railway line.
- Introduce random delays due to breakdown, natural calamities, and maintenance.

### Optimisation

- Find the optimal number of trains per hour and number of signlling blocks such that the delay of a train is no more than half the scheduled time between two consecutive trains.
